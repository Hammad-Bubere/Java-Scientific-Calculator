# Scientific-Calculator
Scientific Calculator in java.
This work was centred on the Design and implementation of a simple scientific calculator for education purpose. The  study traced calculator system as a tool to completely change mathematical knowledge and sophisticated problems solving strategies had advanced the field of simulated engine in mathematic.

This project work also focused principally on  numbers and arithmetic operation. This researcher investigated the manual system in detail with a view to finding out the need to automate the system.

Interestingly, the end result of simple calculator system was its ability to process number and operators, and provides a useful result.
